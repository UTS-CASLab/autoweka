# Auto-WEKA for MCPS (AutoWeka4MCPS)
Auto-WEKA is a tool for automating the selection of methods and hyperparameters of WEKA. This repository contains an extended version of Auto-WEKA now supporting the optimisation of MultiComponent Predictive Systems (MCPS).

## Description
Many different machine learning algorithms exist that can easily be used off the shelf, many of these methods are implemented in the open source WEKA package. However, each of these algorithms have their own hyperparameters that can drastically change their performance, and there are a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall. Auto-WEKA considers the problem of simultaneously composing an MCPS and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous methods that address these issues in isolation. Auto-WEKA does this using a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Our hope is that Auto-WEKA will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.

## Auto-WEKA as a blackbox
Auto-WEKA includes a wizard to find the best MCPS of a given dataset without any user interaction, apart from providing a dataset and a time budget.

## Auto-WEKA as an advanced toolbox
Auto-WEKA allows to select between a list of all WEKA methods and different optimisation strategies and parameters.

## Search space reduction

## Usage 

* Please watch the [video tutorial](https://github.com/UTS-AAi/autoweka/blob/master/autoweka4mcps/autoweka4mcps_quick_start_guide_ui.mp4) for quick start guide with the user interface (autoweka4mcps/autoweka4mcps_quick_start_guide_ui.mp4)
* It's neccessary to allocate more memory for AutoWeka4MCPS to deal with large datasets, e.g., allocating 2GB memory:
```
cd autoweka4mcps
java -Xmx2048m -jar autoweka4mcps.jar
```

* SMAC Configuration: Please configure the file path to SMAC in the following file autoweka.smac.SMACExperimentConstructor.properties

* The experiments folders have to be put in the parent folder of AutoWeka4MCPS (default)

# The Extension of Auto-WEKA for MCPS with the AVATAR
 * This version of Auto-WEKA is extended by integrating the AVATAR (https://github.com/UTS-AAi/AVATAR) . The AVATAR evaluates the validity of ML pipelines using a surrogate model that enables
to accelerate automatic ML pipeline composition and optimisation.
